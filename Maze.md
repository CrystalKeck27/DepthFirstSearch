# Lab 4: Maze Solver
## Learning Objectives
 - Implement small software systems that use one or more stack data structures

## Overview
In this lab, you will implement a maze solver using a stack. The maze will be represented as a 2D array of characters. The maze will be read from a file. The maze solver will find a path from the start to the end, if one exists, and print directions to the console.
